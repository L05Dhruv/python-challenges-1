# Python I Challenges
### Learn the python syntax and create some basic - intermediate algorithms with Python!

## Instructions:
Commit and push regularly.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Complete exercises 1 - 8 `ex1.py` to `ex8.py`. Test your solutions.
3. Complete Max Value (algorithms folder) `max.py`. Test with test case.
4. Complete Password Checker `passwordChecker.py`. Be sure to understand what is being asked and PSEUDO CODE first!. Test with the given code, try multiple password inputs
5. Complete Fibonacci Sequence `fibonacci.py`. Be sure to understand what is being asked and PSEUDO CODE first!. Test with the given code, try different n inputs
6. Complete Prime Number `prime.py`. Be sure to understand what is being asked and PSEUDO CODE first!. Test with the given code, try different number inputs
7. Complete Palindrome Checker `palindrome.py`. Be sure to understand what is being asked and PSEUDO CODE first!. Test with the given code, try different string inputs
8. Complete Guess Number game `guess.py`. Be sure to understand what is being asked and PSEUDO CODE first!. Test with the given code, try different runs of the game.
9. Complete Most Frequent Character algorithm `most_frequent.py`. Run the test cases and make your own test cases.
10. Complete Linked List to array algorithm `linkedList.py`. Run the test case and make your own.
    Be sure to not edit the class 'Node', only change the function body of `linked_list_values`.
12. Complete the Factorial number algorithm `factorial.py`. Run the test case and try your own.
    This algorithm can be solved with a regular loop (iterative solution) but I encourage you to try implementing a RECURSIVE solution.
