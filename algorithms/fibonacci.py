# Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
# starting with 0 and 1.
#
# RETURNS an int

def generate_fib(n):
    # TODO: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n
    pass


# Test the function with the following code
n = int(input("Enter the number: "))
fib_sequence = generate_fib(n)
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, ":", fib_sequence)
